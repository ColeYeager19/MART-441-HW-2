# MART-441-HW-2

I am completely new to JavaScript so despite this week being relatively simple it was still quite difficult for me. Despite doing all the readings I found myself 
lacking the knowledge of what program to write in and how to link the file back to my html document. After a few hours watching video tutorials on how JS
functions I finally had enough understanding of how to write in JS to get by. Still, I am unsure if the method of using variables and linking it to so many console 
logs was what you had in mind. If there is a different or better way to do this in the future please let me know so I can adjust. While I am still shakey on my JS
knowledge I feel a lot more comfortable as we move forward into more advanced lessons. As a final note, the examples provided would not load to a preview window. 
It is possible this was user error but this made the project more difficult because I was basically coding in the hopes of meeting a standard I could not see.
